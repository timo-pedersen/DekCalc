# DekCalc

A tool for plotting graphs. Type a function, press 'compile' and it will be displayed.

Very spikey at the moment, but works.

## ToDo
- ~Add support for complex functions, possibly remove support for pure double functions~
- Add parameter sliders (e.g. ability type in a function `A*Sin(B*x)` and then move corresponding sliders).
- Add proper double buffering and invalidate()
- Save and load workspace (i.e. a library of user functions + misc settings)
- Add library of standard functions
- Ability to show unlimited functions in the same plot
- Proper drawing when function goes out of bounds
- Add Complex viewing modes, look into simple 3d representation, possibly with popup window? 3d plugin?
- Add moving and zooming to plot (mouse)
- Add help, tooltips and help popups.
  - User needs to know the extent of c# math and numerics abilities.
  - Also how to code lambda bodies.
